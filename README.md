# Daniel-s-Adventure-Game

This is a fun, text-based adventure game made with Python. You type commands to explore a world, find items, and try to reach the hidden "Ancient Treasure Chamber."

How to Play

Get the Game File

Download the "adventure_game.py" file from this GitHub page.
Save it on your computer in a folder you can easily find (like "Documents").
Open Your Terminal

On Windows: Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" and open it.
On Mac/Linux: Open the "Terminal" app.
Go to the Game Folder

In the Terminal, type "cd" then a space, then the full path to the folder where you saved "adventure_game.py".
Example: If you saved it in "My Games" inside "Documents", you'd type: cd "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Games" (Remember to change "YourName" to your actual username, and use quotes if the folder name has spaces!)
Run the Game

Once you are in the correct folder, type this command and press Enter: python adventure_game.py
Start Your Adventure!

The game will start with a welcome message.
Type your commands (like "go north", "take old key", "inventory", or "quit") and press Enter after each one. The game will respond with text.
